Breast Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

Overview:
This project aims to develop a deep learning model for the detection of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnosis) Database. Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes and survival rates. Leveraging deep learning techniques can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis.

Dataset:
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnosis) Database contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass. These features describe various characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images, such as radius, texture, smoothness, and symmetry. The dataset includes both benign and malignant cases, making it suitable for binary classification tasks.

Approach:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize feature values, and encode categorical variables.
Model Architecture: Several deep learning architectures are explored, including feedforward neural networks with varying numbers of layers and activation functions.
Training: The models are trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. Training is performed over multiple epochs with different batch sizes.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices are also analyzed to assess the model's ability to correctly classify benign and malignant cases.
Results:
The project achieves promising results, with the best-performing model achieving an accuracy of 1.0 in classifying breast cancer cases. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in medical diagnostics and highlights the potential of AI-driven solutions in improving healthcare outcomes.
